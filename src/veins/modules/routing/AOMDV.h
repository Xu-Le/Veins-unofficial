/**
 * @brief A well known routing protocol designed for MANET.
 *
 * @author Xu Le
 * @ingroup routingLayer
 * @see BaseWaveApplLayer
 * @see RouteRepairInterface
 *
 * M. K. Marina, and S. R. Das, "Ad hoc on-demand multipath distance vector routing," Wirel. Commun. Mob. Comput., 2006; 6:969â€“988.
 * 3.1. Protocol Overview
 * AOMDV shares several characteristics with AODV. It is based on the distance vector concept and uses
 * hop-by-hop routing approach. Moreover, AOMDV also finds routes on demand using a route discovery procedure.
 * The main difference lies in the number of routes found in each route discovery. In AOMDV, RREQ propagation
 * from the source towards the destination establishes multiple reverse paths both at intermediate nodes
 * as well as the destination. Multiple RREPs traverse these reverse paths back to form multiple forward
 * paths to the destination at the source and intermediate nodes. Note that AOMDV also provides intermediate
 * nodes with alternate paths as they are found to be useful in reducing route discovery frequency.
 * The core of the AOMDV protocol lies in ensuring that multiple paths discovered are loop-free and disjoint,
 * and in efficiently finding such paths using a flood-based route discovery. AOMDV route update rules,
 * applied locally at each node, play a key role in maintaining loop-freedom and disjointness properties.
 * 3.1.2. Disjoint paths
 * The following simple and straightforward observation is the basis of our mechanism to find link disjoint paths:
 * If two paths from a node P to a destination D are link disjoint, then they must have unique next hops
 * as well as unique last hops. Note that the converse of this observation is not necessarily true.
 * However, the converse also holds true in general with an additional restriction: if every node on a path
 * ensures that all paths to the destination from that node differ in their next and last hops. This implication
 * provides us with a tool to determine whether two paths via two unique downstream neighbors are link disjoint.
 * They simply need to have unique last hops.
